# Code-Refactoring

## Description
-My goal with this project was to refactor existing code to meet accessibility standards so that the website is optimized for search engines (SEO). This was done by replacing generic div tags with semantic HTML elements, as well as consolidating the css code to use fewer css selectors. This allows the codebase to be read and maintained more easily.

## Usage
-A user may click on the different buttons on the nav bar to be taken to that button's corresponding section in the article of the webpage. A user will see three sections relating to Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. A user will also see an aside on the right side of the webpage with sections relating to Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management.\
